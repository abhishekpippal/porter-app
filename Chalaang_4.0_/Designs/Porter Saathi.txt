PS - The 'Porter Saathi' - An AI voice-first partner for empowerment and accessibility

🔑 Problem Reframed

Many drivers & delivery partners may have:

Limited literacy in English or even Hindi typing skills.

Limited digital literacy (apps can be overwhelming).

Need for hands-free, voice-based access (while driving/working).

Many customers/SMEs also want faster, natural interaction without typing or navigating complex UIs.

So Porter Saathi = Voice-first AI assistant (like Alexa for Porter).

🎯 Core Use Cases for "Porter Saathi"
For Drivers/Partners

“Mujhe agla kaam dikhao” → Saathi reads out nearest delivery jobs.

Navigation help

Voice-guided step-by-step directions without needing to touch the app.

Status updates

“Delivery complete” → marks the job as completed.

Earnings query

“Aaj ka total kitna hai?” → Saathi responds with daily earnings.
